[Back](README.md) to Linux CheatSheets by Ireaneus

## Args

```bash
[user@server1] 7z a       # add
[user@server1] 7z d       # delete
[user@server1] 7z e       # extract
[user@server1] 7z l       # list
[user@server1] 7z t       # test
[user@server1] 7z u       # update
[user@server1] 7z x       # extract with full paths
```

## Example

```bash
[user@server1] 7z a -t7z -m0-lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on archive.7z dir1

7z -t7z        # 7z archive
7z -m0=lzma    # lzma method
7z -mx=9       # level of compression = 9 (ultra)
7z -mfb=64     # number of fast bytes for lzma = 64
7z -md=32m     # dictionary size = 32 Mb
7z -ms=on      # solid archive = on
```

## 7z exit codes

```bash
0       # normal (no errors or warnings)
1       # warning (non-fatal errors)

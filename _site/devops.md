#### Devops meaning: Devps is a cultural sensibility.  It's a unified metrics
#### based approach to making software efficiently and fearlessly using as 
#### much automatin as possible.  

#### Sadly many companies don't have the will or discipline to foster a 
#### true DevOps culture, so they come up with the term "DevOps Engineer" 
#### to make it seem as if the DevOps sensibility has taken hold.

#### In reality they're just looking for infrastructure engineers who 
#### know how to work AWS or Google Cloud

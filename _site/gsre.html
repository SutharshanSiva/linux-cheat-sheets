        <p>Google Site Reliability Engineer - Book</p>

<h1 id="sres-time-allocation">SREs time allocation</h1>

<p>50% time spent on operations, getting service systems stable, operable
design services to be automatic and self healing</p>

<p>50% time spent in development
engage in creative, autonomous engineering, while still retaining the 
wisdom gleaned from the operations side of running a service</p>

<p>In general, an SRE team is responsible for the 
availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring,
emergency response, and capacity planning of their service(s).</p>

<p>Google operates under a blamefree postmortem culture, 
with the goal of exposing faults and applying engineering to
fix these faults, rather than avoiding or minimizing them.</p>

<h1 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h1>

<p>Monitoring should never require a human to interpret 
any part of the alerting domain. Instead, software
should do the interpreting, and humans should be 
notified only when they need to take action.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of valid monitoring output:</p>

<h1 id="alerts">Alerts</h1>
<p>Signify that a human needs to take action immediately in response to something
that is either happening or about to happen, in order to improve the situation.</p>

<h1 id="tickets">Tickets</h1>
<p>Signify that a human needs to take action, but not immediately. The system can‐
not automatically handle the situation, but if a human takes action in a few days,
no damage will result.</p>

<p>#Logging
No one needs to look at this information, but it is recorded for diagnostic or for‐
ensic purposes. The expectation is that no one reads logs unless something else
prompts them to do so.</p>

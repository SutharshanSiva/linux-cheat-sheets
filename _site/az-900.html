<span class="c"># App Service costs</span>
You pay <span class="k">for </span>the Azure compute resources your app uses <span class="k">while </span>it processes requests based on the App Service Plan you choose. The App Service plan determines how much hardware is devoted to your host - <span class="k">for </span>example, whether it<span class="s1">'s dedicated or shared hardware, and how much memory is reserved for it. There is even a free tier you can use to host small, low-traffic sites.

Web Apps
App Service includes full support for hosting web apps using ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. You can choose either Windows or Linux as the host operating system.

API Apps
Much like hosting a website, you can build REST-based Web APIs using your choice of language and framework. You get full Swagger support, and the ability to package and publish your API in the Azure Marketplace

Web Jobs
WebJobs allows you to run a program (.exe, Java, PHP, Python or Node.js) or script (.cmd, .bat, PowerShell, or Bash) in the same context as a web app, API app, or mobile app

Mobile Apps
Use the Mobile Apps feature of Azure App Service to quickly build a back-end for iOS and Android apps. With just a few clicks in the Azure portal you can:

	Store mobile app data in a cloud-based SQL database
	Authenticate customers against common social providers such as MSA, Google, Twitter and Facebook

		# Cool storage tier: optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days.
		# Archive storage tier: for data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days with flexible latency requirements.
Encryption
		# Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE) to meet the organization'</span>s security and regulatory compliance
		<span class="c"># Client-side encryption is where the data is already encrypted by the client libraries. </span>
Replication <span class="k">for </span>storage availability	<span class="c"># A replication type is set up when you create a storage account. The replication feature ensures that your data is durable and always available</span>


<span class="c">## Networking</span>
Azure region: 			<span class="c"># geographic location. East US, West US, and North Europe are examples of region</span>
Virtual network: 		<span class="c"># a logically isolated network on Azure</span>
Network security group: 	<span class="c"># A network security group, or NSG, allows or denies inbound network traffic to your Azure resources. Think of a network security group as a cloud-level firewall for your network</span>

Azure Load Balancer: 		<span class="c"># Azure Load Balancer is a load balancer service that Microsoft provides that helps take care of the maintenance for you. Load Balancer supports inbound and outbound scenarios, provides low latency and high throughput, and scales up to millions of flows for all Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) applications</span>

Azure Application Gateway:  	<span class="c"># If all your traffic is HTTP, a potentially better option is to use Azure Application Gateway. Application Gateway is a load balancer designed for web applications. It uses Azure Load Balancer at the transport level (TCP) and applies sophisticated URL-based routing rules to support several advanced scenarios.</span>

Content Delivery Network:  	<span class="c"># A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. It is a way to get content to users in their local region to minimize latency. CDN can be hosted in Azure or any other location. You can cache content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world and provide better performance to end users. Typical usage scenarios include web applications containing multimedia content, a product launch event in a particular region, or any event where you expect a high-bandwidth requirement in a region.</span>

Azure DNS: 

Latency:
Traffic Manager: 		<span class="c"># Traffic Manager uses the DNS server that's closest to the user to direct user traffic to a globally distributed endpoint</span>

Azure Load Balancer 		<span class="c"># distributes traffic within the same region to make your services more highly available and resilient. Traffic Manager works at the DNS level, and directs the client to a preferred endpoint</span>

<span class="c">## Security</span>

		<span class="c"># Single-Sign-On (SSO). SSO enables users to remember only one ID and one password to access multiple applications. A single identity is tied to a user, simplifying the security model. As users change roles or leave an organization, access modifications are tied to that identity, greatly reducing the effort needed to change or disable accounts.</span>
		<span class="c"># Application management. You can manage your cloud and on-premises apps using Azure AD Application Proxy, SSO, the My apps portal (also referred to as Access panel), and SaaS apps.</span>
		<span class="c"># Business to business (B2B) identity services. Manage your guest users and external partners while maintaining control over your own corporate data Business-to-Customer (B2C) identity services. Customize and control how users sign up, sign in, and manage their profiles when using your apps with services.</span>

Azure Advanced Threat protection: 	<span class="c"># Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a cloud-based security solution that leverages your on-premises Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization. Azure ATP enables SecOp analysts and security professionals struggling to detect advanced attacks in hybrid environments to:</span>

Monitor users, entity behavior, and activities with learning-based analytics
Protect user identities and credentials stored <span class="k">in </span>Active Directory
Identify and investigate suspicious user activities and advanced attacks throughout the <span class="nb">kill </span>chain
Provide clear incident information on a simple timeline <span class="k">for </span>fast triage

Encryption
		<span class="c"># Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data</span>
		<span class="c"># Asymmetric encryption uses a public key and private key pair.</span>
		<span class="c"># encryption of data at rest ensures that the stored data is unreadable without the keys and secrets needed to decrypt it</span>
		<span class="c"># Encrypting data in transit protects the data from outside observers and provides a mechanism to transmit data while limiting risk of exposure.</span>
Types of Encryption
Encrypt raw storage: 	<span class="c"># Azure Storage Service Encryption for data at rest helps you protect your data to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments</span>
Encrypt Virtual machine disks:	<span class="c"># Azure Disk Encryption is a capability that helps you encrypt your Windows and Linux IaaS virtual machine disks</span>
Encrypt databases: 		<span class="c"># Transparent data encryption (TDE) helps protect Azure SQL Database and Azure Data Warehouse against the threat of malicious activity</span>
Encrypt secrets:		<span class="c"># Azure Key Vault to protect our secrets.</span>

Firewalls:
	<span class="c"># Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based, network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources</span>
	<span class="c"># Azure Application Gateway is a load balancer that includes a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that provides protection from common, known vulnerabilities in websites</span>
	<span class="c"># Network virtual appliances (NVAs) are ideal options for non-HTTP services or advanced configurations, and are similar to hardware firewall appliances.</span>

Microsoft Azure Information Protection <span class="o">(</span>MSIP or sometimes referred to as AIP<span class="o">)</span> <span class="c"># is a cloud-based solution that helps organizations classify and optionally protect documents and emails by applying labels.</span>


<span class="c">##  Azure Policy</span>
Azure Policy		<span class="c"># is a service in Azure that you use to define, assign, and, manage standards for resources in your environment. It can prevent the creation of disallowed resources, ensure new resources have specific settings applied, and run evaluations of your existing resources to scan for non-compliance.</span>

Policy definition:	<span class="c"># expresses what to evaluate and what action to take. For example, you could ensure all public websites are secured with HTTPS, prevent a particular storage type from being created, or force a specific version of SQL Server to be used.</span>

Initiatives:		<span class="c"># Initiatives work alongside policies in Azure Policy. An initiative definition is a set or group of policy definitions to help track your compliance state for a larger goal. Even if you have a single policy, we recommend using initiatives if you anticipate increasing the number of policies over time.</span>

Enterprise governance management	<span class="c"># Access management occurs at the Azure subscription level. This allows an organization to configure each division of the company in a specific fashion based on their responsibilities and requirements</span>

Azure Blueprints	<span class="c"># allows you to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implement and adhere to your organization's standards, patterns, and requirements</span>

Azure Service Health can also help you prepare for planned maintenance and changes that could affect the availability of your resources.</span>
			<span class="c"># Resource Health can view the Virtual Machine blade</span>

<span class="c">## Azure Resource Manager</span>
Resource groups		<span class="c"># A resource group is a logical container for resources deployed on Azure.</span>
			<span class="c"># Logical grouping is the aspect that we're most interested in here, since there's a lot of disorder among our resources.</span>
			<span class="c"># If you delete a resource group, all resources contained within are also deleted. Organizing resources by life cycle can be useful in non-production environments</span>
			<span class="c"># Resource groups are also a scope for applying role-based access control (RBAC) permissions</span>
			<span class="c"># Azure portal</span>
			<span class="c"># Azure PowerShell</span>
			<span class="c"># Azure CLI</span>
			<span class="c"># Templates</span>
			<span class="c"># Azure SDKs (like .NET, Java)</span>

role-based access control <span class="o">(</span>RBAC<span class="o">)</span>	<span class="c"># RBAC provides fine-grained access management for Azure resources, enabling you to grant users the specific rights they need to perform their jobs. RBAC is considered a core service and is included with all subscription levels at no cost</span>
					<span class="c"># Segregate duties within your team and grant only the amount of access to users that they need to perform their jobs. Instead of giving everybody unrestricted permissions in your Azure subscription or resources, allow only specific actions at a particular scope.</span>
					<span class="c"># When planning your access control strategy, grant users the lowest privilege level that they need to do their work.</span>
					<span class="c"># Use Resource Locks to ensure critical resources aren't modified or deleted (more on that next!)</span>

resource locks		<span class="c"># Resource locks are a setting that can be applied to any resource to block modification or deletion. Resource locks can set to either Delete or Read-only</span>


<span class="c">##  Predict costs and optimize spending</span>
Enterprise 		<span class="c"># Enterprise customers sign an Enterprise Agreement with Azure that commits them to spend a negotiated amount on Azure services, which they typically pay annually. Enterprise customers also have access to customized Azure pricing.</span>

Web direct		<span class="c"># Direct Web customers pay general public prices for Azure resources, and their monthly billing and payments occur through the Azure website.</span>

Cloud Solution Provider 	<span class="c"># Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) typically are Microsoft partner companies that a customer hires to build solutions on top of Azure. Payment and billing for Azure usage occur through the customer's CSP.</span>

Usage Meters:		<span class="c"># When you provision an Azure resource, Azure creates one or more meter instances for that resource. The meters track the resources' usage, and generate a usage record that is used to calculate your bill.</span>

Resource <span class="nb">type</span>:		<span class="c"># Each meter tracks a particular kind of usage. For example, a meter might track bandwidth usage (ingress or egress network traffic in bits-per-second), the number of operations, size (storage capacity in bytes), or similar items.</span>

Services: 		<span class="c"># The Azure team develops and offers first-party products and services, while products and services from third-party vendors are available in the Azure Marketplace . Different billing structures apply to each of these categories.</span>

Azure billing zones:	<span class="c"># Most of the time inbound data transfers (data going into Azure datacenters) are free. For outbound data transfers (data going out of Azure datacenters), the data transfer pricing is based on Billing Zones.</span>
Zone		Areas
Zone 1		United States, Europe, Canada, UK, France
Zone 2		Asia Pacific, Japan, Australia, India, Korea
Zone 3		Brazil
DE Zone 1	Germany
<span class="c"># In most zones, the first outbound 5 GB per month is free. After that, you are billed a fixed price per GB.</span>

Azure pricing calculator:  	<span class="c"># The Azure pricing calculator is a free web-based tool that allows you to input Azure services and modify properties and options of the services. It outputs the costs per service and total cost for the full estimate.</span>

Region				<span class="c"># Lists the regions from which you can provision a product. Southeast Asia, central Canada, the western United States, and Northern Europe are among the possible regions available for some resources.</span>
Tier				<span class="c"># Sets the type of tier you wish to allocate to a selected resource, such as Free Tier, Basic Tier, etc.</span>
Billing Options			<span class="c"># Highlights the billing options available to different types of customer and subscriptions for a chosen product.</span>
Support Options			<span class="c"># Allows you to pick from included or paid support pricing options for a selected product.</span>
Programs and Offers		<span class="c"># Allows you to choose from available price offerings according to your customer or subscription type.</span>
Azure Dev/Test Pricing		<span class="c"># Lists the available development and test prices for a product. Dev/Test pricing applies only when you run resources within an Azure subscription that is based on a Dev/Test offer.</span>

Products. 			<span class="c"># This tab is where you'll do most of your activity. This tab has all the Azure services listed and is where you'll add or remove services to put together your estimate.</span>
Estimates. 			<span class="c"># This tab has all of your previously saved estimates. We'll go through this process in a moment.</span>
FAQ. 				<span class="c"># Just as it says, this tab has answers to some frequently asked questions.</span>

Azure Advisor:		<span class="c"># is a free service built into Azure that provides recommendations on high availability, security, performance, and cost. Advisor analyzes your deployed services and looks for ways to improve your environment across those four areas</span>
Reduce costs by eliminating unprovisioned Azure ExpressRoute circuits

Azure Cost Management:		<span class="c"># Azure Cost Management is another free, built-in Azure tool that can be used to gain greater insights into where your cloud money is going. You can see historical breakdowns of what services you are spending your money on and how it is tracking against budgets that you have set. You can set budgets, schedule reports, and analyze your cost areas.</span>

Cloudyn:		<span class="c"># Cloudyn, a Microsoft subsidiary, allows you to track cloud usage and expenditures for your Azure resources and other cloud providers including Amazon Web Services and Google. Easy-to-understand dashboard reports help with cost allocation and chargebacks</span>

<span class="c"># Licensing costs</span>
Azure Hybrid Benefit <span class="k">for </span>Windows Server		<span class="c"># To be eligible for this benefit, your Windows licenses must be covered by Software Assurance. The following guidelines will also apply:</span>

Each two-processor 	<span class="c"># license or each set of 16-core licenses is entitled to two instances of up to 8 cores or one instance of up to 16 cores.</span>

Standard Edition 	<span class="c"># licenses can only be used once either on-premises or in Azure. That means you can't use the same license for an Azure VM and a local computer.</span>

Datacenter Edition 	<span class="c"># benefits allow for simultaneous usage both on-premises and in Azure so that the license will cover two running Windows machines.</span>

Azure Hybrid Benefit <span class="k">for </span>SQL Server:		<span class="c"># Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server is an Azure-based benefit that enables you to use your SQL Server licenses with active Software Assurance to pay a reduced rate.</span>

Standard Edition per core licenses with active Software Assurance 	<span class="c"># you can get one vCore in the General Purpose service tier for every one license core you own on-premises.</span>

Enterprise Edition per core licenses with active Software Assurance	<span class="c"># you can get one vCore in the Business Critical service tier for every one license core you own on-premises. Note that the Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server for the Business Critical service tier is available only to customers who have Enterprise Edition licenses.</span>

highly virtualized Enterprise Edition per core licenses with active Software Assurance	<span class="c"># you can get four vCores in the General Purpose service tier for every one license core you own on-premises. This is a unique virtualization benefit available only on Azure SQL Database.</span>
